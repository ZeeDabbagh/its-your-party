# USER STORY

GIVEN that I am a potential adopter WHEN I enter my location THEN I am presented with a list of available pets in nearby shelters



# Description
The app will display a list of available pets based on the user location along with a ‘map view’ of the shelters. We are planning to use the petfinder api if we can get it to work along with map api.
